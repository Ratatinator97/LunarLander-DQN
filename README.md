# LunarLander-DQN
Mini project where I had to implement a solution of the Lunar Lander DQN problem !

The Lunar lander is a classic beginner problem of Deep-Q networks.
Here the environement is simulated with Gym and the DQN is made with Tensorflow and Keras.
You'll find here my code. It has comments in French.

Expect like 300 ~ 400 episodes for the Agent (the DQN) to be good.
